## This is a re-submission of the 'tinycodet' package; updating it to version 0.2.2.
* Changes made:
* Small tweak to the pdf manual.
* Replaced the incorrect uses of the word "class" with "type" in the atomic type casting help file.
* Improved the performance of `stri_join_mat()`, and produced better examples in both help file and website.
* Fixed incorrect regex usage in 2 examples.
* If there are any NOTES/WARNINGS/ERRORS which I have missed (despite my many checks), please inform me before publishing on CRAN.
