\title{The tinyoperations "DRY" functionality}
\usage{
tinyoperations_dry()
}
\description{
"Dont't Repeat Yourself", sometimes abbreviated as "DRY",
is the coding principle not to write unnecessarily repetitive code.
To help you in that effort, the \code{tinyoperations} R package
introduces a few functions:
\itemize{
\item Infix operators for \link[=\%s+ =\%]{in-place modifying string arithmetic}.
\item Infix operators for \link[=\%sget =\%]{in-place modifying string sub-setting}.
\item The \link{transform_if} function, and some related operators.
\item The \link[=\%:=\%]{generalized in-place (mathematical) modification operator}.
}
