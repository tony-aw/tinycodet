\usage{
x \%+ =\% y

x \%- =\% y

x \%* =\% y

x \%/ =\% y

x \%^ =\% p

x \%rt =\% p

x \%logb =\% b

x \%alog =\% b
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a number or numeric (or 'number-like') vector, matrix, or array.}

\item{y}{a number, or numeric (or 'number-like') vector, matrix, or array of the same length/dimension as \code{x}.
It gives the number to add, subtract, multiply by, or divide by.}

\item{p}{a number, or a numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}.
It gives the power to be used.}

\item{b}{a number, or a numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}.
It gives the logarithmic base to be used.}
}
\value{
These operators do not return any value: they are in-place modifiers, and thus modify \code{x} directly.
}
\description{
In-place modifiers for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, root, logarithm, and anti-logarithm. \cr

\code{x \%+ =\% y } is the same as \code{x <- x + y} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%- =\% y } is the same as \code{x <- x - y} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%* =\% y } is the same as \code{x <- x * y} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%/ =\% y } is the same as \code{x <- x / y} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%^ =\% p } is the same as \code{x <- x^p} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%rt =\% p } is the same as \code{x <- x^(1/p)} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%logb =\% b } is the same as \code{x <- log(x, base=b)} \cr
\cr
\code{x \%alog =\% b } is the same as \code{x <- b^x}; if \code{b=exp(1)}, this is the same as \code{x <- exp(x)} \cr
}
\examples{
x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%+ =\% 3 # same as x <- x + 3
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%- =\% 3 # same as x <- x - 3
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%* =\% 3 # same as x <- x * 3
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%/ =\% 3 # same as x <- x / 3
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%^ =\% 3 # same as x <- x^3
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%rt =\% 3 # same as x <- x^(1/3)
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%logb =\% 3 # same as x <- log(x, base=3)
print(x)

x <- matrix(rpois(10, 10), ncol=2)
print(x)
x \%alog =\% 3 # same as x <- 3^x
print(x)

x <- 3
print(x)
x \%alog =\% exp(1) # same as x <- exp(x)
print(x)
exp(3) # notice this is the same.
