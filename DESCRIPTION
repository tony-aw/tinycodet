Description: A tiny R package that adds a few functions to help in your coding etiquette.
    It primarily focuses on 4 aspects.
    1) Safer decimal (in)equality testing, safer atomic conversions, and other functions for safer coding.
    2) A new package import system,
    that attempts to combine the benefits of using a package without attaching,
    with the benefits of attaching a package.
    3) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package.
    4) Reducing repetitive code.
    The 'tinycodet' R-package has only one dependency, namely 'stringi'.
    Most functions in this R-package are fully vectorized and optimized,
    and have been well documented.
