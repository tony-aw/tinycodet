Description: The 'tidyoperators' R-package adds some much needed infix operators,
    and a few functions,
    to make your R code much more tidy.
    It includes infix operators for the negation of logical operators (exclusive-or, not-and, not-in),
    safer float (in)equality operators,
    in-place modifying mathematical arithmetic,
    string arithmetic,
    string sub-setting,
    in-place modifying string arithmetic,
    in-place modifying string sub-setting,
    and in-place modifying unreal replacers.
    The 'tidyoperators' R-package also adds the stringi-like
    stri_locate_ith function.
    It also adds string functions to replace, extract, add-on, transform, and re-arrange,
    the ith pattern occurence or position.
    And it includes some helper functions for more complex string arithmetic.
    Most stringi pattern expressions options (regex, fixed, coll, charclass)
    are available for all string-pattern-related functions, when appropriate.
    This package adds the transform_if function.
    This package also allows integrating third-party parallel computing packages (like stringfish)
    for some of its functions.
