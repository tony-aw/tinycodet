Description: The 'tinyoperations' R-package adds some functions and infix operators to help in your programming etiquette.
    It primarily focuses on 4 things.
    (1) Safer decimal numbers ('double') truth testing.
    (2) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package.
    (3) Reducing repetitive code.
    (4) A new package and module import system, that combines the benefits of aliasing a package with the benefits of attaching a package. 
    The 'tinyoperations' R-package has only one dependency, namely 'stringi'.
    Most functions in this R-package are fully vectorized and optimized.
