Description: The 'tidyoperators' R-package adds some much needed infix operators,
    and a few functions,
    to make your R code much more tidy.
    It includes infix operators for additional logic operators,
    safer float (in)equality operators,
    in-place modifying mathematical arithmetic,
    and infix operators for custom row- and column-wise rank-based ordering of matrices.
    It also adds some 'stringi'-based string related functions, operators, and in-place modifying operators.
    This package adds the transform_if functions, and related operators.
    And finally, it also adds some functions and an operator
    for easier package/library management.
    The 'tidyoperators' R-package has only one dependency, namely 'stringi',
    though it does allows multi-threading of some of the string-related functions
    (when appropriate) via the suggested 'stringfish' R-package.
