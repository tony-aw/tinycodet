Description: The 'tinyoperations' R-package adds some functions and infix operators to help in your programming etiquette.
    It primarily focuses on 4 things.
    1) Safer decimal (in)equality testing, safer atomic conversions, and other functions for safer coding.
    2) A new package import system,
    that combines the benefits of aliasing a package with the benefits of attaching a package.
    3) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the `stringi` R package.
    4) Reducing repetitive code.
    The 'tinyoperations' R-package has only one dependency, namely 'stringi'.
    Most functions in this R-package are fully vectorized and optimized,
    and have been well documented.
