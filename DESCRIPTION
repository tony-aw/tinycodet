Description: The 'tidyoperators' R-package adds some much needed infix operators,
    and a few functions,
    to make your R code much more tidy.
    It includes infix operators for the negation of logical operators
    (exclusive-or, not-and, not-in),
    safer float (in)equality operators,
    in-place modifying mathematical arithmetic,
    string arithmetic,
    string sub-setting,
    in-place modifying string arithmetic,
    in-place modifying string sub-setting,
    in-place modifying unreal replacers,
    and infix operators for custom row- and column-wise rank-based ordering of matrices.
    The 'tidyoperators' R-package also adds the stringi-like
    stri_locate_ith and stri_join_mat functions.
    It also adds string functions to replace, extract, add-on, transform, and re-arrange,
    the ith pattern occurrence or position.
    Most stringi pattern expressions options
    are available for the string-pattern-related functions, when appropriate.
    This package adds the transform_if function.
    This package also allows integrating third-party parallel computing packages
    (like stringfish)
    for some of its functions.
