Description: The 'tinyoperations' R-package adds some infix operators, and a few functions.
    It primarily focuses on 4 things.
    (1) Decimal numbers ("double") truth testing.
    (2) Reducing repetitive code.
    (3) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package.
    (4) A new package and module import system, that combines the benefits of aliasing a package with the benefits of attaching a package. 
    The 'tinyoperations' R-package has only one dependency, namely 'stringi'.
    However, it does allows multi-threading of some of the string-related functions (when appropriate) via the suggested 'stringfish' R-package.
    Most functions in this R-package are fully vectorized and have been optimized for optimal speed and performance.
