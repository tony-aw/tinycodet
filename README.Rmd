## Overview

'tinycodet' adds some functions to help in your coding etiquette. It primarily focuses on 4 aspects:

 1) Safer decimal (in)equality testing, safer atomic conversions, and other functions for safer coding.
 2) A new package import system, that attempts to combine the benefits of using a package without attaching, with the benefits of attaching a package.
 3) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package.
 4) Reducing repetitive code.

'tinycodet' adheres to the [tinyverse](https://www.tinyverse.org/) philosophy (not to be confused with the tidyverse). It has only two dependencies: 'stringi' and 'collapse'. No other dependencies, thus avoiding "dependency hell". Most functions in this R-package are vectorized and optimised.

Although this is a relatively small R package, I do understand you may not want to go through all the articles and help files of 'tinycodet' without knowing if the R package is even worth your time. Therefore, to get a quick glimpse of what 'tinycodet' provides, I humbly invite you to take a look at the [Get Started](https://tony-aw.github.io/tinycodet/articles/tinycodet.html) page on the website (https://tony-aw.github.io/tinycodet/).



```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

## Installation

One can install 'tinycodet' from CRAN like so:


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinycodet")
```

Or get the development version from GitHub like so:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/tony-aw/tinycodet")
```


And attach the package - thus exposing its functions to the namespace - using:

```{r}
library(tinycodet)
```

And one can open the introduction help page of the 'tinycodet' package using any of the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?tinycodet::tinycodet
?tinycodet::`tinycodet-package`
?tinycodet::tinycodet_help
```
